        <div class="gallery-item" data-title="Walter white" data-description="Walter Hartwell White Sr. or Walt, also known by his pseudonym Heisenberg and frequently referred to as Mr. White, was an American chemist, school teacher, and major narcotics distributor from Albuquerque, New Mexico, whose drug empire became the largest meth operation in U.S. history, surpassing those of both Gustavo Fring and the Cartel. Before entering the drug trade, Walt worked as an overqualified high school chemistry teacher at J. P. Wynne High School while holding a second job at the A1A Car Wash to financially support his family (his wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., and infant daughter Holly). After being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Walt began manufacturing chemically pure methamphetamine to provide for his family upon his death. Knowing nothing about the drug trade, Walt enlisted the help of his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to sell the meth he produced." data-image="C:\Users\Suriya\Desktop\workspace\imagemapping\app\static\walter white.jpg">

Originally a low-level methamphetamine dealer who worked with his friend and fellow meth cook Emilio Koyama, Jesse is best known as the former business and meth cook partner of his former chemistry teacher Walter White, teaming up with Walt for two years to help him manufacture chemically pure crystal methamphetamine so Walt could provide for his family (his wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., and infant daughter Holly) upon his death. Alongside catalyzing Walt's drug empire and being the second biggest player in it after Walt himself, Jesse and Walt were also the leaders of a short-lived meth distribution chain which his friends and fellow meth distributors were also a part of." data-image="C:\Users\Suriya\Desktop\workspace\imagemapping\app\static\jesse pinkman.jpg">

Originally collaborating with the Mexican drug cartel to distribute their cocaine, Gus eliminated his dependence on the cartel and began distributing methamphetamine himself. Soon enough he became the kingpin of his solo drug empire, which was the most successful drug operation in United States history until his former employee Walter White surpassed it with his own drug empire." data-image="C:\Users\Suriya\Pictures\gus.jpg">

Originally from Cicero, Illinois during his career as a scam artist, Jimmy moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico where he worked as a lawyer, and later resided as a fugitive in Omaha, Nebraska before being caught and apprehended in a federal prison at Montrose, Colorado. During his law career, Jimmy embraced his tendencies as a former scam artist and, after becoming a dedicated and effective criminal lawyer, he began to represent criminals while he himself became increasingly involved in the city's criminal underworld, all the while slowly losing his morality along the way. Despite his flamboyant appearance and mannerisms, Saul was a highly competent lawyer who was able to solve problems and find loopholes in order to protect his clients. His business name, "Saul Goodman, is a play on the phrase "it's all good, man.""  data-image="C:\Users\Suriya\Pictures\saul godman.jpg">

Hank is the husband of Marie Schrader and the brother-in-law of Skyler and Walter White, as well as the uncle of Walter White Jr. and Holly, having a close friendship with his nephew. As a DEA agent, Hank lead the investigations of the methamphetamine cook Heisenberg (unaware for over a year that he was actually his own brother-in-law), as well as Gustavo Fring and his drug empire. Hank is faced with numerous threats from the rival drug cartels which take a toll on his mental health, causing him to develop post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a hobby, Hank home brews his own SchraderbrÃ¤u beer, and also takes up mineral collecting. Despite his brashness, Hank is highly competent at his job and cares deeply about his family." data-image="C:\Users\Suriya\Pictures\Hank Schrader.jpg">
